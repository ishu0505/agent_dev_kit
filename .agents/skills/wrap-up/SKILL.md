name: wrap-up
description: Finish a task so the docs stay true - run the checks, compare the branch's docs with its code, offer to refresh stale learning docs, offer catch-up for code written by hand, and write the explain-diff section for a pull request. Use at the end of every task, when the user says the work is done, and always before opening or updating a pull request.

# Wrap-up

The last step of every task. It keeps the human in the loop: it reports
what it found and asks before each larger change. Never commit unless the
user asks.

## 1. Checks

Run `sh .agents/kit/check.sh`. Fix what fails, and report what you fixed.
Problems marked `WARN` are not part of this task: list them, do not fix
them unless the user asks.

## 2. Docs of this branch

Find the base: the branch the work will merge into (`main` by default).
Run the `docs-sync` skill in check mode with scope `since <base>`. When it
finds drift caused by this task, propose the fixes and apply the ones the
user approves (`docs-sync fix`).

## 3. Learning docs

Read `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/agent-kit/stale-learning` (the Stop
hook writes it) and `sh .agents/kit/stale.sh since <base>`. If learning docs
are stale, ask once: "N learning docs describe code this task changed.
Refresh them now?" On yes, run the `learning-docs` skill with scope `stale`,
then empty the stale-learning file. On no, leave the file; the next session
start shows it.

## 4. Code written by hand

If `sh .agents/kit/queue.sh count` is above zero, tell the user and offer
the `catch-up` skill. Do not run it without a yes.

## 5. Pull request

When a pull request is being opened or updated, run the `explain-diff`
skill for `since <base>` and put its section in the pull request
description (replace the old section between the markers; never add a
second one).

## 6. Report

A short list: checks (pass or fixed), docs changed, learning docs
refreshed or still stale, catch-up items, and whether the pull request
section was written.
