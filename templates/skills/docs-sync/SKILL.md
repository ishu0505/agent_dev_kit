name: docs-sync
description: Check whether the code and the docs agents and humans read (AGENTS.md maps, READMEs, decisions, learning docs) still agree, and optionally make the docs match the code. Use when the user asks "are the docs in sync", before merging a branch (wrap-up runs it), after a refactor, after a pull of other people's changes (the session start says commits from other people arrived), or when an agent seems misled by a doc. Modes - check (report only) or fix. Scope - since <git ref> (default the base branch), pulled (what other people's commits changed since the docs were last checked), a unit path, or all.

# Docs sync

`.agents/kit/check.sh` catches mechanical drift: a long map, a dead path, a
missing file. It cannot see that a README names an old default or that a
learning doc describes a removed step. This skill does that reading.

**Arguments.** Mode: `check` (default; change nothing) or `fix`. Scope:
`since <ref>` (default `since main`, or the repo's default branch: only
what this branch changed), `pulled` (what other people's commits changed
since the docs were last checked on this branch: the same as
`since $(sh .agents/kit/pulled.sh base)`), a unit path, or `all` (every doc
against its own last update; slower). Settings come from
`.agents/agent-kit.conf`.

Use `pulled` after a pull, merge or rebase brought in other people's work:
`sh .agents/kit/pulled.sh status` lists those commits. On `main` after a
pull, `since main` finds nothing, so `pulled` is the scope that sees them.

## 1. Run the checks

Run `sh .agents/kit/check.sh`. Every failure goes into the report.

## 2. Find the candidates (git only, no reading yet)

Run `sh .agents/kit/stale.sh since <ref>` (or `sh .agents/kit/stale.sh` for
scope `all`). It lists each doc whose **anchors** changed, with the files:

- a map: the paths it names (a named folder counts only when a file in it
  is added, removed or renamed);
- a detail doc (`README.agentk.md`) or a README people wrote
  (`README.md`): the paths in its `<!-- agent-kit: source_paths ... -->`
  line, else its folder;
- a learning doc: its `source_paths` since its `source_commit`;
- an accepted decision: its `source_paths` (with `DECISIONS_DIR`).

Only these docs are read in step 3. For a unit path, keep the docs inside
it. With `DECISIONS_DIR` empty, also read each `accepted` entry of
the decision index that names a changed file. When a kit detail doc has no
anchor line and keeps showing up for unrelated changes, add one in `fix`
mode.

The third column says who owns each doc: `kit` (the kit wrote it: maps,
pointer files, files ending in `.agentk.md`) or `yours` (people wrote it).
Read both. Fix only `kit` docs; see `.agents/kit/writing-style.agentk.md`,
"Which files you may edit".

## 3. Read and compare

For each candidate, read the doc and the code diff since the doc's commit.
List every claim that is now false:

- paths, commands and scripts (does the file or target exist?);
- env vars and settings (grep the code for each name the doc gives);
- defaults, limits, ports, versions;
- interfaces: function names, routes, message fields, CLI flags;
- flow steps in learning docs (does each named function still do that?);
- invariants: search for a violation (e.g. a provider SDK imported outside
  the one module allowed to call it).

A claim you cannot confirm or refute is "unverified", not "wrong".

**In a team repo** (`MAPS="beside"`), also compare each of your maps
(`AGENTS.agentk.md`) with the team's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` in the same
folder and above it. List every place where yours contradicts theirs or
repeats them. The team wins: the fix is always in your map.

## 4. Report

Two tables, each grouped by unit:

**Kit docs** (`fix` mode changes these):

| Doc | Claim | What the code does | Evidence | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Conflicts with the team's rules** (team repo only; fix your map):

| Your map | Your line | Team file | Their line | Fix in your map |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Your docs: report only** (the people fix these themselves):

| Doc | Line | Says | What the code does | Evidence | Sentence to paste |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Evidence is `file:line`. End with: docs checked, docs in sync, docs with
drift, unverified claims. In `check` mode, stop here and change nothing.

## 5. Fix (`fix` mode only)

- **Docs follow the code.** Never change code to match a doc.
- A change that breaks an invariant or an `accepted` decision is not fixed
  silently. Ask the user: was the code change intended? If yes, record a new
  decision with the `lineage` skill and update the invariant. If no, it is a
  bug: leave the doc, and report the bug.
- Rewrite stale map lines and kit detail docs (`README.agentk.md`) by
  `.agents/kit/writing-style.agentk.md`. Keep maps within their line limits.
- **Never edit a `yours` doc** (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/*.md`
  and other Markdown the kit did not write). Leave its rows in the "Your
  docs" table for the people to fix.
- Refresh stale learning docs with the `learning-docs` skill (it updates
  each `source_commit`).
- **Scope `pulled`: who fixes what.** Other people wrote these commits, so
  ask before each group:

  | Doc | After other people's commits |
  |---|---|
  | Kit docs that stay on this computer: learning docs that are not shared, every kit doc with `SHARE="none"` or `MAPS="beside"` | Yours. Offer the fix; apply it after the user's yes |
  | Kit docs the repo shares (`SHARE="agent"` or `"all"`: maps, decisions; learning docs with `"all"` or `"learning"`) | The other person's pull request should have updated them. Report the drift. Offer the fix on a new branch (`docs/sync-<date>`) for a pull request; never commit it to the default branch |
  | Docs people wrote (`README.md` and the rest) | Report only, with a sentence to paste, as above |

## 6. Mark the docs as checked

After a run with scope `pulled` (check or fix), run
`sh .agents/kit/pulled.sh done`, so the next session start does not report
the same commits again. If the user chose to fix later, do not run it.
- Run `sh .agents/kit/check.sh` again and show that it passes. Report every
  file changed.
